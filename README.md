# Frontend Mentor - Agency Landing Page

This is my solution to the [Frontend Mentor Agency Landing Page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef). The goal was to build a fully responsive, visually polished landing page based on the provided Figma design.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**
- **Vite**
- **SCSS**
- **HTML5**
- **Netlify** for hosting
- **Figma** for design reference
- **Jira** for task tracking
- **Git** for version control
- **ChatGPT** for occasional support

## 📱 Features

- Fully responsive layout across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Smooth, modern small-screen navigation menu
- Clickable arrow in header scrolls smoothly to the first section

- Accessibility and usability improvements

## 💡 Challenges

The most difficult part of this project was implementing the **responsive layout** to match the Figma design across all screen sizes, especially managing layout shifts and flex/grid behavior for large screens.

Additional improvements beyond the challenge requirements:
- Added smooth scrolling to the first section when clicking the header arrow
- Improved small-screen menu transitions and behavior

## ✅ Requirements Met

- [x] Pixel-perfect layout based on Figma design
- [x] Responsive design on all screen sizes
- [x] Smooth navigation UX
- [x] TypeScript support
- [x] Hosted live with Netlify
- [x] Source control with Git
- [x] Feature-based task tracking via Jira

## 📌 Final Notes

This project was a great opportunity to practice modern frontend tools (TypeScript, Vite, SCSS) and refine my responsive design skills. I also explored subtle UX enhancements to improve navigation and animation behavior beyond the original scope.

Thanks to the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) community and tools like ChatGPT for support throughout the process!
